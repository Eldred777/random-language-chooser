# random-language-chooser
Chooses a random language from a database file. This is really just a small tool to choose a language to do Advent of Code in if I want a bit of spice in my life. Part of the fun of this was to figure out Haskell's tooling system as well, from a personal perspective!

Run with `make` in the project directory. Modify `db/languages.db` if you wish to change which languages are chosen from. 
Alternatively, run `make stack` then `./app/main.exe`.
